main operation you can do on a stack

push -> put something on the stack  #actual CPU Instructions
pop -> take something off the stack

peak -> look at the item on top of the stack
is empty -> is the stack empty or not

Need these to implement a stack
# list -- a place to store the data that we push
# the location in the list of the top of the stack


Let's:
* store the stack data in RAM
* use R7 to hold the address of he otp of hte stack 
    * gets initialized to 0xf4 when the achine boos up

Not the LS-8 but a stakc all the same:
  v
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 index
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 value

PUSH 5
PUSH 7
PUSH 2

Stack is general purpose not special purpose

Instructions:

PUSH R0
RUSH R1
POP R2 <<
POP R1

Push:

1. Decrement the SP (R7) (Hex #)
2. Copy the value in the given register to the address pointed by SP

Pop: 
1. Copy the value from memory at the addrss pointed from by stack pointer (SP) into hte register
2. Increment the SP

R[7]  ==  F2
RAM[F2] == 32
RAM[R[7]]==32
